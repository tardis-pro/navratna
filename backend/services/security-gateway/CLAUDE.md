## Security Gateway Service Overview

The Security Gateway is the **authentication, authorization, and security orchestration hub** for the Council of Nycea UAIP platform. It runs on port 3004 and handles all security-related operations including JWT validation, OAuth provider management, approval workflows, audit logging, and agent security validation.

## Architecture

### Core Responsibilities
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation, MFA (TOTP, SMS, hardware tokens), session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC), capability-based permissions for AI agents
- **OAuth Integration**: Multi-provider OAuth flows (GitHub, Gmail, Zoho, Microsoft, Custom)
- **Approval Workflows**: Human approval requirements for high-risk operations
- **Audit & Compliance**: Comprehensive security event logging and audit trails
- **Agent Security**: AI agent capability validation and security assessment

### Key Components

#### Service Layer (`src/services/`)
- **SecurityGatewayService**: Core security validation and risk assessment
- **EnhancedAuthService**: JWT validation, MFA, session management
- **OAuthProviderService**: Multi-provider OAuth integration with PKCE
- **ApprovalWorkflowService**: Workflow orchestration with cron jobs
- **AuditService**: Security event logging and compliance tracking
- **NotificationService**: Security alert notifications

#### Route Layer (`src/routes/`)
- **authRoutes**: Login, logout, MFA, session management
- **securityRoutes**: Security validation, risk assessment
- **oauthRoutes**: OAuth provider management and flows
- **approvalRoutes**: Approval workflow management
- **auditRoutes**: Audit log access and reporting
- **userRoutes**: User management and preferences
- **knowledgeRoutes**: Personal knowledge CRUD operations

## Key Patterns and Architecture

### Service Initialization
The service extends `BaseService` from `@uaip/shared-services` and follows a structured initialization pattern:
1. Database and event bus connection
2. Service dependency injection
3. Route setup with middleware
4. Event subscription setup (standard + enterprise)
5. Cron job initialization

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Standard Event Bus**: Internal service communication via RabbitMQ
- **Enterprise Event Bus**: Enhanced compliance and audit features
- **WebSocket Authentication**: Real-time auth validation for other services

### Security Validation Flow
1. **Risk Assessment**: Multi-factor scoring based on user type, auth method, capabilities
2. **Policy Evaluation**: Dynamic security policy matching and enforcement
3. **Approval Requirements**: Automatic approval workflow triggering for high-risk operations
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event tracking

### OAuth Integration
- **PKCE Implementation**: Secure OAuth flows with Proof Key for Code Exchange
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Extensible provider system with per-provider configurations
- **Agent-Specific Connections**: OAuth connections tied to AI agent capabilities

## Testing Architecture

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests** (`src/__tests__/unit/`): Service logic testing with comprehensive mocking
- **Integration Tests** (`src/__tests__/integration/`): End-to-end flows with real database
- **Security Demo Tests**: Security validation demonstrations and examples

### Test Configuration
- **Jest with TypeScript**: ESM support with ts-jest preset
- **Coverage Threshold**: 70% minimum across branches, functions, lines, statements
- **Module Mapping**: Workspace imports properly resolved for testing
- **Mock Services**: Comprehensive mock implementations in `utils/mockServices.ts`

### Running Specific Tests
```bash
# OAuth flow integration tests
jest src/__tests__/integration/oauth-flow.integration.test.ts --runInBand --forceExit

# Security validation tests
jest src/__tests__/integration/security-validation.integration.test.ts --runInBand --forceExit

# Enhanced security integration
jest src/__tests__/integration/enhancedSecurityIntegration.test.ts --runInBand --forceExit
```

## Import Patterns

### Workspace Dependencies
```typescript
// Shared services and utilities
import { BaseService } from '@uaip/shared-services';
import { validateJWTToken } from '@uaip/middleware';
import { SecurityLevel, Operation } from '@uaip/types';
import { logger } from '@uaip/utils';

// Local imports within service
import { SecurityGatewayService } from '@/services/securityGatewayService.js';
import authRoutes from '@/routes/authRoutes.js';
```

### Path Mapping
- `@/services/*`: Maps to `src/services/*`
- `@/routes/*`: Maps to `src/routes/*`

## Security Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- **TOTP**: Time-based One-Time Passwords with QR code generation
- **SMS**: SMS-based verification
- **Hardware Tokens**: Hardware security key support
- **Biometric**: Biometric authentication integration

### Agent Capability System
Fine-grained permissions for AI agents:
- `CODE_REPOSITORY`: Repository access and code operations
- `EMAIL_ACCESS`: Email reading and sending capabilities
- `FILE_MANAGEMENT`: File system operations
- `API_ACCESS`: External API integration
- `DATABASE_ACCESS`: Database operation permissions

### Risk Assessment Framework
Multi-factor risk scoring considers:
- User type (human vs agent)
- Authentication method strength
- OAuth provider trust level
- Operation type and resource sensitivity
- Device and location trust factors
- Time-based factors (off-hours, weekends)

### Approval Workflows
- **Automatic Triggering**: High-risk operations automatically require approval
- **Role-Based Approvers**: Configurable approval chains based on operation type
- **Escalation Paths**: Time-based escalation for pending approvals
- **Audit Integration**: All approval decisions logged for compliance

## Development Guidelines

### Service Development
- Extend `BaseService` for consistent initialization patterns
- Use dependency injection for service dependencies
- Implement proper error handling with `ApiError` from `@uaip/utils`
- Follow event-driven patterns for inter-service communication

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Create integration tests for complete workflows
- Maintain 70% code coverage minimum
- Use proper mocking for external dependencies

### Security Considerations
- Never log sensitive information (tokens, passwords, API keys)
- Use secure random generation for tokens and secrets
- Implement proper rate limiting for all endpoints
- Follow principle of least privilege for permissions
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
