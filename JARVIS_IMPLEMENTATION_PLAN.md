## üéØ The Jarvis Experience

**User**: *"Hey Jarvis, analyze the security logs from last night and create a report"*

**System Flow**:
1. Voice Master detects wake word + intent
2. Routes to Security Specialist Agent + Artifact Generation Agent  
3. Security Agent analyzes logs (using existing Capability Registry tools)
4. Artifact Agent generates report (using existing Artifact Service)
5. Voice Master synthesizes results into natural speech
6. Maintains conversation state for follow-up questions

This transforms your existing sophisticated agent platform into a true voice-first AI assistant while leveraging all the enterprise-grade infrastructure you've already built.
