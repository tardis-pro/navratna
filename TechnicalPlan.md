Council of Nycea: Technical Debt Cleanup Plan

Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis, the codebase has
moderate technical debt with excellent
foundational architecture. Redis and Neo4j are
fully integrated. The main issues center around
duplicate patterns, large files, and insufficient
testing coverage.

---

🔴 Phase 1: Critical Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

1.1 Service Pattern Consolidation

Priority: CRITICALImpact: 40% reduction in
duplicate codeEffort: 1 week

Tasks:

- Create BaseService class in
  /backend/shared/services/src/BaseService.ts
- Consolidate duplicate Express setup patterns
  across 7 services
- Extract common middleware chains (helmet,
  compression, rate limiting)
- Standardize graceful shutdown logic

Files to Refactor:

- /backend/services/\*/src/index.ts (7 services)
- /backend/shared/services/src/ (new BaseService)

  1.2 DatabaseService Decomposition ✅ COMPLETED

Priority: CRITICALImpact: Improved
maintainability, reduced couplingEffort: 1 week

Completed Tasks:
✅ Break down 2,175-line DatabaseService into
domain services:
✅ UserService (user operations + LLM providers)
✅ ToolService (tool operations + executions)
✅ AgentService (agent operations)
✅ ProjectService (project operations)
✅ SecurityService (security policies)
✅ AuditService (audit trails)
✅ ArtifactService (artifact management)
✅ SessionService (session management)
✅ MFAService (multi-factor auth)
✅ OAuthService (OAuth providers)
✅ Implement proper dependency injection
✅ Fix lazy loading race conditions
✅ Domain-specific repository organization

Files Refactored:
✅ /backend/shared/services/src/databaseService.ts
(delegated to domain services)
✅ Created 10+ domain service files with proper
abstractions
✅ Fixed LLM provider repository organization

1.3 JWT Validation Consolidation

Priority: CRITICAL (Security)Impact: Single
source of truth for authenticationEffort: 3 days

Tasks:

- Consolidate JWT validation logic from 4+
  locations
- Create unified JWTValidator class
- Standardize token validation patterns
- Remove duplicate authentication middleware

Files to Refactor:

- /backend/shared/middleware/src/authMiddleware.ts
- /backend/services/security-gateway/src/index.ts
- /backend/services/security-gateway/src/services
  /enhancedAuthService.ts

🟠 Phase 2: Large File Refactoring (Weeks 3-4)

2.1 Frontend API Utility Breakdown

Priority: HIGHImpact: Improved
maintainabilityEffort: 4 days

Tasks:

- Split 2,295-line
  /apps/frontend/src/utils/api.ts into:
  - authApi.ts (authentication endpoints)
  - agentApi.ts (agent management)
  - toolApi.ts (tool operations)
  - projectApi.ts (project management)
  - discussionApi.ts (discussion endpoints)

  2.2 Backend Controller Refactoring

Priority: HIGHImpact: Better code
organizationEffort: 3 days

Tasks:

- Refactor /backend/services/agent-intelligence/s
  rc/controllers/agentController.ts (1,332 lines)
- Refactor /backend/services/orchestration-pipeli
  ne/src/orchestrationEngine.ts (1,328 lines)
- Split into focused, single-responsibility
  modules

  2.3 Legacy Pattern Modernization

Priority: HIGHImpact: Consistency and
maintainabilityEffort: 3 days

Tasks:

- Replace Promise chains with async/await (25+
  files)
- Enable TypeScript strict mode gradually
  star

---

🟡 Phase 3: Testing & Quality (Weeks 5-6)

3.1 Integration Test Implementation

Priority: HIGHImpact: Improved reliabilityEffort:
1 week

Tasks:

- Add integration tests for authentication flows
- Test core database operations (currently 0%
  coverage)
- Create WebSocket handler tests
- Implement agent orchestration tests

  3.2 Unit Test Coverage

Priority: MEDIUMImpact: Better code
qualityEffort: 1 week

Tasks:

- Add unit tests for business logic
- Test tool execution patterns
- Mock external dependencies properly
- Achieve 80% coverage target

---

🟢 Phase 4: Performance & Architecture (Weeks
7-8)

4.1 Database Optimization

Priority: MEDIUMImpact: Better performanceEffort:
4 days

Tasks:

- Add database indexes on frequently queried
  fields
- Fix N+1 query problems in repository patterns
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Add query performance monitoring

  4.2 Architecture Improvements

Priority: MEDIUMImpact: Better
maintainabilityEffort: 4 days

Tasks:

- Implement hexagonal architecture patterns
- Create service interfaces to reduce coupling
- Standardize error handling patterns
- Add proper logging throughout

🔧 Implementation Strategy

Week-by-Week Breakdown

Week 1: BaseService creation + service pattern
consolidation (IN PROGRESS)
Week 2: DatabaseService decomposition ✅ COMPLETED + JWT consolidation
Week 3: Large file refactoring (frontend API utils)
Week 4: Backend controller refactoring + legacy modernization
Week 5: Integration test implementation
Week 6: Unit test coverage improvements
Week 7: Database optimization + performance tuning
Week 8: Architecture improvements + final cleanup

📊 Current Status (2025-01-06):
✅ Phase 1.2 Complete: DatabaseService decomposition
🔄 Phase 1.1 In Progress: Service pattern consolidation
🔄 Phase 1.3 Pending: JWT validation consolidation

Key Achievements:

- Successfully organized repositories by domain
- Fixed build errors in ToolService
- Established proper dependency injection patterns
- LLM providers properly organized in UserService domain

Risk Mitigation

- Gradual Migration: Implement new patterns
  alongside old ones
- Feature Flags: Use feature toggles for major
  changes
- Rollback Strategy: Keep original
  implementations until new ones are proven
- Testing: Comprehensive testing before removing
  old code

Success Metrics

- Code Reduction: 40% reduction in duplicate code
- File Size: No files >500 lines (target: <300
  lines)
- Test Coverage: 80% coverage on business logic
- Performance: 25% improvement in API response
  times
- Maintainability: Reduced complexity scores
  across all services

📊 Resource Requirements

Team Size: 2-3 developersTimeline: 8 weeksRisk
Level: LOW (mostly refactoring, not new
features)Dependencies: None (internal cleanup)

Estimated Impact:

- Maintenance Time: 50% reduction in bug fix time
- New Feature Velocity: 30% improvement
- Code Quality: Significantly improved
  maintainability
- Developer Experience: Better onboarding and
  debugging

This plan addresses the real technical debt
issues while preserving the excellent
architectural foundation you've built. The focus
is on consolidation, testing, and modernization
rather than architectural overhaul.
