# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Council of Nycea is a **Unified Agent Intelligence Platform (UAIP)** - a production-ready backend infrastructure for multi-agent collaboration, intelligent discussion orchestration, and capability-driven automation. The system uses a microservices architecture with a hybrid database strategy and event-driven communication.

## Development Notes

- You use puppeteer on 5173 always
- Its running in docker compose is hotreloading
- You are in pnpm workspace, always think global, extend configs, no private local thing unless explicitly required or deemed necessary
- IMPORTANT: ALWAYS SEARCH FOR RELEVANT CODE FOR THE THING YOU ARE DOING, DONT DUPLICATE, USE SHARED INTERFACES. ALWAYS

### Core Services
- **Agent Intelligence** (3001) - Modular AI agent management with 6 specialized microservices, context analysis, persona handling
- **Orchestration Pipeline** (3002) - Workflow coordination, operation management, tool execution orchestration
- **Capability Registry** (3003) - Tool management, sandboxed execution, enterprise tool adapters (Jira, Confluence, Slack)
- **Security Gateway** (3004) - Authentication, authorization, OAuth providers, MFA, agent security dashboard
- **Discussion Orchestration** (3005) - Event-driven real-time collaborative discussions via WebSocket
- **LLM Service** (llm-service) - Multi-provider LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) with MCP protocol support
- **Artifact Service** (artifact-service) - Code generation, documentation, PRD creation

### Database Architecture
- **PostgreSQL** (port 5432) - Primary database with TypeORM entities
- **Neo4j** (port 7474/7687) - Graph database for agent relationships and knowledge graph  
- **Qdrant** (port 6333) - Vector database for semantic search and embeddings
- **Redis** (port 6379) - Caching, sessions, pub/sub
- **RabbitMQ** (port 5672) - Event-driven messaging between services

### Knowledge Graph Architecture
The platform implements a **triple-store knowledge architecture** where every knowledge item exists with the same UUID across three specialized systems:

- **PostgreSQL**: Structured data, metadata, relationships, access control
- **Neo4j**: Graph relationships, contextual connections, recommendation algorithms
- **Qdrant**: Vector embeddings, semantic search, similarity matching

**Universal Sync Process:**
```typescript
// Automatic bidirectional synchronization
KnowledgeBootstrapService.runPostSeedSync() ‚Üí {
  1. Discovers existing data across all systems
  2. Creates unified UUID mapping
  3. Syncs missing items to other systems
  4. Maintains relationship consistency
  5. Generates vector embeddings
}
```

## Import Patterns (Critical)

**This is a monorepo** - always use workspace imports, never relative paths across packages.

### ‚úÖ Correct monorepo imports:
```typescript
// Cross-package imports
import { Operation } from '@uaip/types/operation';
import { logger } from '@uaip/utils/logger';
import { DatabaseService } from '@uaip/shared-services/databaseService';

// Local imports within a service
import { config } from '@/config/config';
import { AgentService } from '@/services/agentService';
```

### ‚ùå Never use relative paths across packages:
```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS
import { Operation } from '../../../shared/types/src/operation';
import { logger } from '../../../shared/utils/src/logger';
```

## Build Dependencies 

**Build  ** - Just build it will building the entire set:

1. `pnpm build` - Build packages/shared-types, packages/shared-utils, backend/shared/*

## Key Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with ES Modules
- **Language**: TypeScript (ES2022 target)
- **Backend**: Express.js with comprehensive middleware stack
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components

- **Real-time**: WebSocket for agent discussions and live updates
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime validation
- **Testing**: Jest with TypeScript support, comprehensive mocking system
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspace support

## Development Workflow
3. You are in a ec2 work instance, you make a change, its hot reloaded. 
4. always use pupeeter to test some ui things, 
4. **Access system**: Frontend at http://localhost:3000, API docs at http://localhost:8081/docs

For focused development, use minimal services: `cd backend && npm run dev:minimal`

## Testing Access

- Default admin credentials: `admin/admin`
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8081
- Health checks: http://localhost:8081/health
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

- **Window Uniqueness**: Only one chat window per agent with proper focus management and duplicate prevention
- **Universal Knowledge Graph Sync**: Bidirectional synchronization across PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and Qdrant with UUID consistency

## Recent Session Achievements

### ‚úÖ Universal Knowledge Graph Synchronization System (2025-01-06)

Successfully implemented a comprehensive **bidirectional knowledge synchronization system** that ensures every knowledge item has a consistent UUID across PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and Qdrant:

**üåü Key Features:**
- **Universal Discovery**: Automatically discovers existing knowledge items across all three systems
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Handles data starting in PostgreSQL ‚Üí Neo4j + Qdrant, Neo4j ‚Üí PostgreSQL + Qdrant, or Qdrant ‚Üí PostgreSQL + Neo4j
- **UUID Consistency**: Every knowledge item maintains the same UUID across all systems
- **Post-Seed Integration**: Runs after database seeding to sync any existing data
- **Forward-Only Design**: No rollbacks - system continues forward and self-improves over time
- **Resilient Architecture**: Continues even if individual systems fail, graceful degradation

**üìÅ Implementation Files:**
- `/backend/shared/services/src/knowledge-graph/knowledge-sync.service.ts` - Core synchronization logic
- `/backend/shared/services/src/knowledge-graph/bootstrap.service.ts` - Startup and post-seed coordination
- Enhanced `QdrantService` with UUID-based point operations
- Extended `KnowledgeRepository` with bidirectional discovery methods

**üîÑ Sync Process:**
1. **Discovery Phase**: Scans PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and Qdrant for existing knowledge items
2. **Universal Mapping**: Creates unified view of which items exist where
3. **Smart Sync**: Only syncs to missing systems (efficient, no duplicates)
4. **Relationship Sync**: Maintains knowledge relationships in Neo4j graph
5. **Vector Embedding**: Generates and stores embeddings in Qdrant with UUID metadata

**üöÄ Usage:**
```typescript
// Post-seed synchronization
const bootstrapService = new KnowledgeBootstrapService(dependencies);
await bootstrapService.runPostSeedSync();

// Verify sync status
const status = await bootstrapService.verifyItemSync(itemId);
// Returns: { postgres: true, neo4j: true, qdrant: true, allSynced: true }

// Get sync statistics
const stats = await bootstrapService.getSyncStatistics();
// Returns counts of items synced from each source
```

### ‚úÖ Tool System Architecture Alignment (2025-01-04)
Successfully resolved all build errors and aligned the tool system with the vision of **universal augments for both humans and agents**:

**Key Improvements:**

- **Intelligent Deduplication**: Smart merge of similar knowledge items across systems
- **Graph Analytics**: Neo4j-powered knowledge relationship insights and recommendations
- **Semantic Search**: Advanced vector search with contextual filtering and ranking

## Troubleshooting

- **Port conflicts**: Check ports 3000-3005, 5432, 6379, 6333, 7474, 8081
- **Database connection**: Ensure infrastructure started and ready (~30-60 seconds)
- **Memory issues**: System requires minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- **Build failures**: Always build shared packages first with `npm run build:shared`
- **Import errors**: Check monorepo import patterns, verify path mappings in tsconfig.json
- **Test failures**: Middleware tests expect proper mock setup; check Jest configuration and workspace imports

### Knowledge Graph Troubleshooting

- **Sync issues**: Check `KnowledgeBootstrapService.getSyncStatistics()` for sync status across systems
- **Qdrant connection**: Verify Qdrant is running on port 6333, check collection initialization
- **Neo4j connection**: Test with `RETURN 1` query, verify port 7687 and authentication
- **Embedding failures**: Check TEI/embedding service availability and dimensions match (default: 768)
- **UUID mismatches**: Run `bootstrapService.verifyItemSync(itemId)` to check consistency
- **Performance issues**: Monitor batch sizes in sync operations, adjust `batchSize` config
