# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Council of Nycea is a **Unified Agent Intelligence Platform (UAIP)** - a production-ready backend infrastructure for multi-agent collaboration, intelligent discussion orchestration, and capability-driven automation. The system uses a microservices architecture with a hybrid database strategy and event-driven communication.

## Development Notes

- You use puppeteer on 5173 always
- Its running in docker compose is hotreloading
- You are in pnpm workspace, always think global, extend configs, no private local thing unless explicitly required or deemed necessary

## Common Development Commands

### Start Development Environment
```bash
# Full system (takes ~2 minutes to start)
npm run dev

# Infrastructure only (databases, message queue)
./dev-start.sh --services infrastructure --daemon

# Backend services only
npm run dev:backend

# Frontend only  
npm run dev:frontend

# Minimal development (core services only)
cd backend && npm run dev:minimal
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build everything (shared packages, backend, frontend)
npm run build

# Build shared packages first (required before backend)
npm run build:shared

# Build backend services
npm run build:backend

# Build frontend
npm run build:frontend
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests across packages
npm test

# Test specific packages
cd backend/shared/middleware && npm test  # Middleware tests (132 tests)
cd backend/shared/services && npm test   # Services tests

# Test artifact generation system
npm run test:artifacts

# Test specific artifact types
npm run test:artifacts:prd
npm run test:artifacts:code
```

**Test Coverage Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Middleware Package**: Complete test suite with 8 test suites and 132 passing tests
  - Authentication & authorization middleware
  - Error handling and transformation
  - Request validation with Zod schemas  
  - Rate limiting functionality
  - Request/response logging
  - Prometheus metrics collection
  - Agent validation and transformation logic

### Linting
```bash
# Lint all packages
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## Architecture Overview

- **Redis** (port 6379) - Caching, sessions, pub/sub
- **RabbitMQ** (port 5672) - Event-driven messaging between services

## Import Patterns (Critical)

**This is a monorepo** - always use workspace imports, never relative paths across packages.

### ‚úÖ Correct monorepo imports:
```typescript
// Cross-package imports
import { Operation } from '@uaip/types/operation';
import { logger } from '@uaip/utils/logger';
import { DatabaseService } from '@uaip/shared-services/databaseService';

// Local imports within a service
import { config } from '@/config/config';
import { AgentService } from '@/services/agentService';
```

### ‚ùå Never use relative paths across packages:
```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS
import { Operation } from '../../../shared/types/src/operation';
import { logger } from '../../../shared/utils/src/logger';
```

## Build Dependencies 

**Build  ** - Just build it will building the entire set:

1. `pnpm build` - Build packages/shared-types, packages/shared-utils, backend/shared/*

## Key Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with ES Modules
- **Language**: TypeScript (ES2022 target)
- **Backend**: Express.js with comprehensive middleware stack
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: TypeORM with PostgreSQL, Neo4j for graph data
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for agent discussions and live updates
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime validation
- **Testing**: Jest with TypeScript support, comprehensive mocking system
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspace support

## Development Workflow
3. You are in a ec2 work instance, you make a change, its hot reloaded. 
4. always use pupeeter to test some ui things, 
4. **Access system**: Frontend at http://localhost:3000, API docs at http://localhost:8081/docs

For focused development, use minimal services: `cd backend && npm run dev:minimal`

## Testing Access

- Default admin credentials: `admin/admin`
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8081
- Health checks: http://localhost:8081/health
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

## Key Patterns

- **Security**: All requests go through Security Gateway for auth/authz with MFA and OAuth integration
- **Events**: RabbitMQ for async communication between services with event-driven discussion flows
- **Real-time**: Enterprise WebSocket connections for agent discussions and live security monitoring
- **Caching**: Redis for API responses, sessions, and real-time data with performance optimization
- **Audit**: Comprehensive audit trails for all operations with security dashboard visualization
- **Sandboxing**: Secure tool execution in Capability Registry with enterprise tool adapters
- **Multi-agent**: Sophisticated agent personas with modular microservice architecture (6 specialized services)
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol support for enhanced AI reasoning and tool capabilities
- **Tool Execution**: Unified tool execution service across all microservices for consistent patterns
- **Enhanced Agents**: Tool attachment system with real-time execution during conversations
- **Knowledge Separation**: User knowledge (Security Gateway) vs Agent knowledge (Agent Intelligence) architecture
- **Chat Capabilities**: Configurable agent chat features (knowledge access, tool execution, memory enhancement)
- **CORS Centralization**: All CORS handling at nginx gateway level for simplified security management
- **Chat History Management**: Comprehensive chat history browser with time-grouped sessions and export capabilities
- **Modal-Based Editing**: Streamlined agent editing without navigation disruption using modal overlays
- **Event-Driven Chat Communication**: Custom events for clear intent separation between new and resume chat actions
- **Window Uniqueness**: Only one chat window per agent with proper focus management and duplicate prevention

## Recent Session Achievements (2025-01-04)

### ‚úÖ Tool System Architecture Alignment
Successfully resolved all build errors and aligned the tool system with the vision of **universal augments for both humans and agents**:

**Key Improvements:**
- **Unified Security Model**: Removed separate `ToolSecurityLevel` enum, aligned all tools to use universal `SecurityLevel` (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- **Type System Consolidation**: Fixed `UnifiedToolDefinition` to properly extend base `ToolDefinition` without conflicts
- **Project Management Enhancement**: Added `PAUSED` status to `ProjectStatus`, extended project settings with `allowedTools` array
- **Service Access Improvements**: Added public getter methods to `DatabaseService`, implemented singleton pattern for `EventBusService`
- **Technical Debt Removal**: Eliminated type mismatches, fixed validation schemas, streamlined repository access patterns

**Build Status:** ‚úÖ **All packages now build successfully**
- Shared packages: ‚úÖ Clean builds
- Backend services: ‚úÖ Full compilation success  
- Frontend: ‚úÖ Production build ready

### üéØ Next Steps: Tool System Evolution

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. **Tool Execution Engine**: Implement the simplified execution methods currently stubbed out
2. **Neo4j Integration**: Connect tool relationship and recommendation systems
3. **Redis Cache Layer**: Implement tool usage caching and performance optimization
4. **Project Tool Integration**: Complete the project-tool association features
5. **Enterprise Tool Adapters**: Expand Jira, Confluence, Slack integrations

**Architecture Goals:**
- **Human-Agent Parity**: Ensure tools work identically for human users and AI agents
- **Security Consistency**: All tools follow the same security framework across the platform
- **Performance Optimization**: Tool execution with proper caching and rate limiting
- **Graph-Based Discovery**: Neo4j-powered tool recommendations and relationships

## Troubleshooting

- **Port conflicts**: Check ports 3000-3005, 5432, 6379, 7474, 8081
- **Database connection**: Ensure infrastructure started and ready (~30-60 seconds)
- **Memory issues**: System requires minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- **Build failures**: Always build shared packages first with `npm run build:shared`
- **Import errors**: Check monorepo import patterns, verify path mappings in tsconfig.json
- **Test failures**: Middleware tests expect proper mock setup; check Jest configuration and workspace imports
