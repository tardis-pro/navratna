# Orchestration Pipeline Service Integration Analysis

## Service Overviews

### Orchestration Pipeline Service
Manages complex workflow operations through their entire lifecycle. Key features:
- Operation execution with state management
- Pause/resume with checkpointing
- Compensation logic for rollbacks
- monitoring of monitoring of dependent services

### Artifact Service
Generates technical artifacts from discussions. Key features:
- Listens to `discussion.completed` events
- Analyzes conversations using NLP
- Generates code, tests, docs, etc.
- Auto-shares artifacts via short links

### Agent Intelligence Service
Manages AI agents and conversations. Key features:
- Processes `agent.chat.request` events
- Provides conversational interfaces
- Manages personas and knowledge
- Offers conversation enhancement

## Cross-Service Workflow

```mermaid

    participant OP as Orchestration Pipeline
    participant AI as Agent Intelligence
    participant AS as Artifact Service
    OP->>AI: Request agent capabilities
    AI-->>OP: Provide agent configurations
    OP->>AS: Trigger artifact generation
    AS-->>OP: Return generated artifacts
    OP->>AI: Execute agent-based workflow steps
    AI-->>OP: Return step results
```

```

## Code Integration Points
1. **Artifact Service Trigger**:
   - Orchestration Pipeline can call `POST /api/v1/artifacts`
   - Or emit `discussion.completed` events with operation context

2. **Agent Utilization**:
   - Orchestration Engine uses `agent.chat.request` events
   - Direct API calls to `/api/v1/agents`

3. **Shared Infrastructure**:
   - Event bus (`@uaip/event-bus`)
   - Database service (`@uaip/database`)
   - Authentication (`line_count>50line_count>50line_count>50line_count>50line_count>50</line_count>
